# RoadColors

What follows below are minor additions I made to create a similar plot for Atlanta.

- Added R projects and the `here` packages.
- Installed new fonts for the legend via the `extrafont` package. Used CabernetJFPro font to resemble font from the [Atlanta TV Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(TV_series))
- Changed background/text colors to roughly match the Atlanta Braves color scheme.
- Changed radius to extend barely past the I-285 perimeter (for maximum ITP snobbery).

Here's the latest output:
